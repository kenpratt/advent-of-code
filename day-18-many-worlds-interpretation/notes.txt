For path, store:
- position
- path so far
- keys visited in order
- keys left to visit
- doors left to visit

For score: path length minus num keys and doors visited

For hueristic: Manhattan distance to furthest key/door?

Doors treated as inaccessible until have key.
- Factor into hueristic? I think no, just do path to furthest item, best path could happen to be through all doors.
- Maybe instead of Manhattan distance should do astar distance assuming all doors are open, though?
