- Write a method to render a fancier version of the map. Maybe an ascii map with:
  - Borders between the cells
  - Room name
  - Items in room
  - ...I wonder if it may be easier to output HTML?

- Should ensure that there's no:
  - Duplicate items (array removal and set won't work)
  - Doors that lead to paths that aren't on the grid (eg left-down-right leads to a different room than down)
    - There are! east-east-down-east-north-west is != east-east
    - So, I need to get rid of coords I guess and just do neighbours? That's gonna make the printer harder...
      - Or I could relabel coords when this happens, eg shift all x values from that point to the right one,
        but that doesn't totally solve it as then my current visiting neighbours code breaks.
    - Maybe better to just get rid of grid? Renderer will be harder though.

- Tell the bot to explore, by keeping a list of unexplored rooms
  - Use A* to navigate there

- TODO pressure sensitive rooms
