- Write a method to render a fancier version of the map. Maybe an ascii map with:
  - Borders between the cells
  - Room name
  - Items in room
  - ...I wonder if it may be easier to output HTML?

- Should ensure that there's no:
  - Duplicate items (array removal and set won't work)
  - Doors that lead to paths that aren't on the grid (eg left-down-right leads to a different room than down)

- Tell the bot to explore, by keeping a list of unexplored rooms
  - Use A* to navigate there

- TODO pressure sensitive rooms
